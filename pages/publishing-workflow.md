<!--
The big news is that we now have a complete command-line workflow for publishing, which means it's fully automatable.

You just need to set your GitHub personal access token and run `alr publish`.

Alire will create a pull request for you automatically and even puts it in draft mode initially, so you can review the automated checks before requesting a review.

# Publishing Status

```bash
$ alr publish --status
```

```

Arguments:

$ alr publish --cancel=5 --reason="Obsolete"

<!--
You can track the status of your submissions with `alr publish --status`.

This shows you all your pending pull requests, their current status, whether checks are ongoing, failed, or passed, and direct links to the GitHub pull requests.

You can also interact with them directly from the command line: request a review or cancel a submission with a reason.
