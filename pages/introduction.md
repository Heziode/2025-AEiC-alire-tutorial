# The Alire package manager for Ada and SPARK

<!--
Hello everyone.
I'am Quentin DAUPRAT and I'll introduce you Alire, the package manager for Ada and SPARK, with a special focus on the new features and improvements introduced in versions 2.0 and 2.1. 
This tutorial is originally made by Alejandro Mosteo and Fabien Chouteau, but they cannot be present for this tutorial, so I will be your presenter.
This tutorial is divided into two parts: 

- first, a general presentation of Alire through these slides, covering its core concepts and recent enhancements; It is write more like an update than a complete courses, but don't worry, we will go deep.

- second part is a hands-on exercise session where we'll put these concepts into practice, with brief recaps of the key points from the presentation. Let's get started with discovering how Alire can simplify your Ada development workflow.

Here's what we'll cover today.
We'll start with some background and context about package managers in general.
Then dive into the Alire ecosystem, explore various use cases, discuss the publishing workflow, look at dependency management features, examine shared builds, cover some miscellaneous improvements and breaking changes, and finally wrap up with contacts and resources.
